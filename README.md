# roster_generator

This program takes in a list of players, prices and positions, takes in the budget price as well as the acceptable amount of money to be unused to generate all the possible standard fantasy football rosters consisting of one qb, two rbs, three wrs, one te, one def and one flex (either an rb, wr or te).

The players.csv, as well as the main.py file must be present to run the program.

After running the first menu option of the program, a rosters.csv file is generated.  This is required to exist in order to run the second menu option of filtering rosters.
